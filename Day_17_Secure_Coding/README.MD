Description: After handling unrestricted file uploads and SQLi vulnerabilities, McSkidy continued to review Santa's web applications. She stumbled upon user-submitted inputs that are unrecognizable, and some are even bordering on malicious! She then discovered that Santa's team hadn't updated these web applications in a long time, as they clearly needed more controls to filter misuse. Can you help McSkidy research and learn a useful technique to handle that in the future?
