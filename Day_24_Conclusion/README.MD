Description: Ah, what a month! As McSkidy watched Santa’s sleigh take off, loaded with gifts, she sighed with relief.
We did it! McSkidy walks through Santa's workshop while other elves go about their pending tasks Looking around the workshop, she could see Santa’s SOC Team working on their tasks. Some were setting up additional defenses, some were implementing new security policies,
and some were trying out new skills (and hats!) too. The Bandit Yeti walks away from Santa's compund. There are some things McSkidy can’t see, but would be vital for you to know. The Bandit Yeti tears down the board with his 2022 evil plan. The Bandit Yeti has left the area and returned to his lair, defeated for now. The Yeti crosses out 2022 and writes 2023 to start off planning for next year. If we could look inside his planning room, we’d see the beginnings
of a new scheme, but let’s not worry about that today! McSkidy enters the SOC room. As McSkidy returned to her office, she looked at her desk,
where just 24 days ago, an evil-looking card was placed. Now that spot was occupied by a scroll with a massive security to-do list. McSkidy unrolls the scroll with the security to-do list. They all worked hard to clear as many items as possible, but many remain.
Security is never done! McSkidy crosses out the Save Christmas item off the list However, with Santa in the air, she could cross out “Save Christmas” off the list. Success! McSkidy and the whole Elf team celebrate victory with a nice Christmas meal. McSkidy and all the Elves from Santa’s Security Team thank you for your help this year. They promised to call you if they get into trouble in 2023!
