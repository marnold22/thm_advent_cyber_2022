Description: Elf McSkidy was doing a regular sweep of Santa's workshop when he discovered a hardware implant! The implant has a web camera attached to a microprocessor and another chip. It seems like someone was planning something malicious... We must try to understand what this implant was trying to do! We will deal with the microprocessor and the web camera in future tasks; for now, let's try to uncover what that other chip is being used for.
