# Day_23 [Defence-in-Depth] Mission ELFPossible: Abominable for a Day

+ Deployable Website: Yes
+ Deployable Container: No

Description: Every effort you have put through builds on top of each other to bring you right at this moment. Santa and the security team are so proud of you for sticking around and being with us until now. You’re practically a member of the SSOC team already! There’s just one more thing left to learn: a lesson that may completely change how you look at and approach security.

Throughout all the previous tasks, layering defenses and reducing attack surfaces have been touched upon at least once. Writing secure code and being able to respond and analyse different parts of the attack chain, among others, are all essential in maintaining Santa's Security Posture defensible. In this task, we will focus on what is formally known in security circles as Defense in Depth, which is a more general and encompassing topic than the prior ones on their own.

## LEARNING OBJECTIVES

## NOTES

1. Let’s look at it at three varying levels of defense:
   1. The first level is having a focus on perimeter security. There are great prevention mechanisms present in the perimeter and essentially complete trust within it; thus, once the perimeter is bypassed, the organisation is pretty much at the mercy of the adversary.
   2. The second level has defensive layers in place; however, the emphasis is solely on prevention. It doesn’t leverage ‘knowing your environment’; even though adversarial objectives may be prevented to some degree, there’s a missed opportunity in terms of detection and consequently, alerting and response. Prevention is good, but the key to defeating the bad guys is having visibility into what they are doing.
   3. The third level has well-rounded defensive layers in place, leveraging the strategic application of sensors, effective creation of analytics, and efficient alerting and response capabilities of the security team. Preventative measures here are not only coupled by detection and alerting but also by immediate and efficient response.

## STEPS

1. Launch Site
2. Run through all 3 stages of the defense
